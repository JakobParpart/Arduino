  This program makes use of a photoresistor, servo and a push button.
  The photoresistor is used to detect the light, depending on the light that it takes in
  determines how far the servo will turn to either direction.
  This is supposed to mimic an automated gate. Once the button is pushed, If there is light, the gate will open.
  If the button is pushed but no light, the servo will stay "closed"
  This could be used in your everyday life, say your driving up to your property,
  to open the gate you would usually have to get out and manually open it. Or you have a remote.
  But what if the gate malfunctions and opens even if you havent pressed the remote. This would leave your house vulnerable.
  Using this you have to push the button, then when driving up to the gate,
  the photoresistor will sense the light from your headlights. THis will open the gate.
  Once you have passed through, the gate will close after it doesn't sense light from your headlights or tailights.
 
  Board Setup:
  5V pin -> positive strip on breadboard
  GND pin -> negative strip of breadboard
  DIO 9 -> Input side of servo
  Positive strip -> Middle pin of servo
  GND strip -> GND pin of Servo
  DIO 2 -> positive leg of push button
  GND strip -> Negative leg of push button
  GND strip -> 330ohm resistor -> Photoresistor
  A0 -> Analog leg of Photoresistor
  GND strip -> Negaive leg of Photoresistor
