This program makes use of a laser, photoresistor, piezo and 4 LEDs, a button and RFID scanner.
The button has 3 states, on, reset, and off. 
There are two LED's to let you know whether the system is armed or disarmed.
Once you turn on the system, the laser will shine at the photoresistor.
Once the beam is interrupted by something passing by, the piezo will sound and the LED's will blink.
A message will be sent to your phone via discord. This is done using a discord bot.
To turn off the piezo and lights you simply press the button once to reset the system.
If the system is armed you can scan the RFID card to prevent the system from going off even if its armed.
Board Setup:
DIO 3 -> positive of piezo
DIO 4-> Red LED
330ohm resistor from ground to negative leg of Red LED
DIO 5-> Green LED
330 ohm resistor from GND to negative leg of Green LED
DIO 6 -> positive side of button
DIO 7 -> Blue LED
330 ohm resistor from GND to negative leg of Blue LED
DIO 8 -> Red LED
330 ohm resistor from GND to negative leg of Red LED
GND strip -> negative side of piezo
DIO 9 -> SDA on Scanner
DIO 10 -> MOS on scanner
DIO 11 -> MI on Scanner
DIO 12 -> ISO on scanner
DIO 13 -> SCK on Scanner
GND -> GND of scanner
A0 -> photoresistor
GND -> 330 ohm resistor -> photoresistor
positive strip -> photoresistor
GND strip -> negative pin of laser
3.3V pin -> positive pin of laser
