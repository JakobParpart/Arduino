Tutorial 4 RGB LED

This Tutorial makes use of an RGB LED along with three potentiometers.
Each potentiometer is in charge of controlling the brightness of each LED
One for red, one for green and one for blue.
The potentiometers are reprogrammed to include values between 0 and 255.
This allows for precise control of the color of the individual LEDS.
Since I am using three seperate potentiometers you can mix the colors to create millions of different variations.

Board Setup:
DIO 5 (pwm) -> 330 ohm resistor -> Blue leg of LED
DIO 6 (pwm) -> 330 ohm resistor -> Green leg of LED
DIO 9 (pwm) -> 330 ohm resistor -> Red leg of LED

5V -> positive strip on breadboard
GND -> ground strip on breadboard

A0 -> Blue Potentiometer
A1 -> Green Potentiometer
A2 -> Red Potentiometer

Ground strip to ground leg of RGB LED

Each of the potentiometers have a wire going from the ground strip to the ground legs on the potentiometers.
Each potentiometer has a wire going from the positive strip to the positive leg on the potentiometer.
