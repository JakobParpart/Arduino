This program makes use of 10 LEDS total. Along with a potentiometer.
3 red LEDS, 3 yellow LEDS, 3 green LEDS and one blue LED
Twisting the potentiometer will turn on the leds in order from the 1st red LED to the last green one.
When the potentiometer is turned to max all the LEDS will b on along with the blue one. 
The blue LED is just to show that the potentiometer is turned all the way.
