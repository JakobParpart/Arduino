This program makes use of a potentiometer along with a RGB LED in order to precisely control the brightness of the LED.
Turning the potentiometer changes the brightness.

Board Setup:

GND port goes to negative side of Potentiometer
GND port goes to the ground leg of the RGB LED
GND goes to the back of the breadboard to the negative strip
A0 port goes to the outside leg of the potentiometer
A1 port goes to a pair of LEDS in parallel. 
One leg of the led is infront of the other with the other legs stuck into the negative strip on the breadboard
3.5V port goes to other outside leg of Potentiometer
DIO 12 goes to a 220 ohm resistor followed by the red leg of the LED
DIO 11 goes to a 220 ohm resistor followed by the green leg of the LED
DIO 10 goes to a 220 ohm resistor followed by the blue leg of the LED
