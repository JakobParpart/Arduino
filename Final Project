This program makes use of a laser, photoresistor, piezo and 4 LEDs and a button.
The button has 3 states, on, reset, and off. 
There are two LED's to let you know whether the system is armed or disarmed.
Once you turn on the system, the laser will shine at the photoresistor.
Once the beam is interrupted by something passing by, the piezo will sound and the LED's will blink.
To turn off the piezo and lights you simply press the button once to reset the system.
Board Setup:
DIO 4-> Red LED
330ohm resistor from ground to negative leg of Red LED
DIO 5-> Green LED
330 ohm resistor from GND to negative leg of Green LED
DIO 6 -> positive side of button
DIO 7 -> Blue LED
330 ohm resistor from GND to negative leg of Blue LED
DIO 8 -> Red LED
330 ohm resistor from GND to negative leg of Red LED
GND strip -> negative side of piezo
DIO 12 -> positive of piezo
A0 -> photoresistor
GND -> 330 ohm resistor -> photoresistor
positive strip -> photoresistor
GND strip -> negative pin of laser
3.3V pin -> positive pin of laser
