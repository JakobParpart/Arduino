This program makes use of a motion sensor, piezo and a SPDT switch.
The switch will either arm or disarm the system.
If motion is detected by the motion sensor, the piezo will sound and a red LED will flash.
To disarm the system simply slide the switch to the off position.

   Serial.begin(9600); //start of serial monitor
   pinMode(2, INPUT);//Use pin 2 to receive the signal outputted by the module
