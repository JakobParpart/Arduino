This program makes use of a potentiometer, transistor and motor.
The potentiometer changes the speed of the motor depending on how far its twisted.
Along with this I have wired up 3 LED's. 
One red, one yellow and one green.
They will light up in order from red to green.
Red is from values 0 -> 85.
Yellow is from values 85 -> 170
Green is from values 170-255.
This will allow the user to see how far the potentiometer is turned
Along with this I have a serial monitor printout which allows you to see
what the value of the potentiometer is. 
Therefore increasing the potentiometer will increase the motor speed but also tell you the speed
precisely with the serial monitor and roughly with the three LED's

Board Setup
A0 -> Analog leg of Potentiometer
DIO 3 -> Emitter leg of Transistor
DIO 11 -> 330ohm resistor -> Red LED
DIO 12 -> 330ohm resistor -> Yellow LED
DIO 13 -> 330ohm resistor -> Green LED
